# Star Builder

A StarFinder character management app.

## Development

This project is pre-alpha, and not yet suitable for use.

## Contributions

If you're interested in helping, feel free to reach out to me. In addition to contacting me through Github, you can reach me as Berggen on Paizo's website, John Uckele in the Boston SFS scene, or u/juckele on reddit.

Biggest thing I could use help with is generating and updating the data assets. I could also use contributions from coders, especially those who can test on iOS.
